CODE INJECTOR injects code in intercepted HTML pages, this folder contains two files: BeEF and Javascript. 

code_injector_beEF.py assumes you are using BeEF framework and has been already configured. 
Yoy may need to modify <injection_code> variable within the code itself.
Use "cat code_injector_beEF.py" to inspect the content of the file and replace the example IP address with your
system's IP address. 

code_injector_javascript.py currently uses a weak javascript code to inject to the HTML page as an example. 
You need to insert the javascript code you want to insert within the HTML page. 

Please note you will only be able to inject code once you have become MITM. Use the ARP SPOOFER program in this 
suite of tools to achieve this.
