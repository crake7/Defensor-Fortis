# Defensor-Fortis

The following tools have been created to exploit system weaknesses and vulnerabilities using Python 2 and 3. 
(You may need to minimally tweak the program depending on the version you use).  

Each folder is provided with a text file named "howto" which explains how to use each program in detail. Should
you require any further guidance, feel free to contact me as well. 

I recommend using Metasploitable to test the exploits.
