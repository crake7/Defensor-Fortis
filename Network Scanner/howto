NETWORK SCANNER:
Scans network and discovers the IP and MAC address of all connected clients. 

Use Linux bash terminal and add command: python network_scanner.py -t <IP_Range/subnet_mask>
Example: python3 network_scanner.py -t 10.0.0.1/24

If using more than one interface, one NIC should be turned off. 
You may use ifconfig/ipconfig <NIC> down.
