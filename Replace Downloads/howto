REPLACE DOWNLOAD:
This program is able to recognize when a target is downloading a file from an HTTP page and then replaces it on the fly.
This program assumes you are running a static web server and will be providing an executable to the target.
You may also use this program with HTTPS. Check out the README file to see how to bypass HTTPS.

Before running the program:
1. You will need to intercept the packets from the target computer and forward them. 
If you do know need to bypass HTTPS, you will need to type the following command on the Linux bash terminal:
iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

You will also need to allow the target to have internet connection. Type in the terminal:
echo 1 > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward

Instead, if you are using SSL STRIP, you only need to type in the terminal:
iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

2. Do not forget to start the web server you will use to provide target with the executable file. Type in terminal:
service apache2 start

Optional: If you previously modified the iptables, you will ned to flush the previous rules. Type in terminal:
iptables --flush

-Become the MITM. (You may achieve this using the ARP SPOOFER programs in this suite of tools.)

Now, on the replace_downloads.py file you will need to input the IP of your static web server and the absolute URL
where the target will get the executable from. If your target will download a file form an HTTP page, select port 80 on line 22.
However if your target will use HTTPS, select port 10000 on line 29. Use "cat replace_downloads.py" to see where to make these changes.

Once you have finished, do not forget to flush your iptables rules by typing in the terminal:
iptables --flush.
