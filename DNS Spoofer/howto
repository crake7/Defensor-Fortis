DNS SPOOFER folder contains two very different programs: net-cut.py and dns_spoof.py. I will go in more detail on the inner
workings on each of them and their requirements.

--net-cut.py is a very simple program to cut or restablish the internet connection of a victim computer. 
This tool can be used with social engineering techniques to persuade the target to give away valuable information. 

Before running program:
1. You will need to receive all the target network packets and keep them on a queue:
To achieve this, type the following command on Linux bash terminal:
iptables -I FORWARD -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

2. Become MITM (you may use the ARP SPOOFER programs in this suite of tools to achieve this).

Now you can run net-cut.py program. You may uncomment either <packet.accept()> or <packet.drop()> depending on the 
objective of the attack. 


--dns_spoof.py this program redirects DNS requests by redirecting a target from one website to another. This program
assumes you are running a static website.

Before running program:
1. You will need to redirect the input/output packets to a queue:
To achieve this, type the following command on the Linux bash terminal:
iptables -I INPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0
iptables -I OUTPUT -j NFQUEUE --queue-num 0

2. Make sure your web server is running. As I used the pre-installed web serber of Kali Linux, I typed in the terminal:
service apache2 start

3. Become MITM (you may use the ARP SPOOFER programs in this suite of tools to achieve this).

Now you can run, dns_spoof.py program. You will need to modify the website
